# Suggestion-Mining
# Abstraction
The textual information is uploaded tremendously in the internet with different forms of social network platforms like
Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, Forums and Review Sites. Most of the customers depend on opinions of consumers to purchase any
item or visiting any place. Sentiment analysis is one such research area to extract the opinions like positive, negative or neutral
of consumers on a particular product or service by analysing their reviews. The reviewers also specify suggestions to companies
or organizations to improve their quality of product or service. Suggestion mining is one type of sentiment analysis which
is used to extract suggestions like tips, wishes and recommendations from the text by analysing their text. The researchers
proposed different types of methods like rule based, feature based, machine learning based and deep learning based approaches
for suggestion mining. In machine learning based approaches, it is difficult to represent the text by considering syntactic and
semantic information of text. In this work, a Deep Learning based approach is proposed for suggestion mining to identify
whether a sentence is a suggestion or non-suggestion. The SemEval 2019 Competition subtask-A suggestion mining dataset is
used in this experiment. The word2vec and GloVe methods are used for generating word embeddings. Different deep learning
techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit and BERT models are used in
this experimentation. The BERT model attained best accuracy for suggestion mining when compared with other deep learning
techniques.
